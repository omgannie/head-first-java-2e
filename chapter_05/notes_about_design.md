# Bullet Points

* Your Java program should start with a highlevel
design.
* Typically you’ll write three things when you
create a new class:
  * prepcode
  * testcode
  * real (Java) code
* Prepcode should describe what to do, not how
to do it. Implementation comes later.
* Use the prepcode to help design the test
code.
* Write test code before you implement the
methods.
* Choose for loops over while loops when you
know how many times you want to repeat the
loop code.
* Use the pre/post increment operator to add 1
to a variable (x++;)
* Use the pre/post decrement to subtract 1 from
a variable (x--;)
* Use `Integer.parseInt()` to get the int
value of a String.
* `Integer.parseInt()` works only if the
String represents a digit (“0”,”1”,”2”, etc.)
* Use break to leave a loop early (i.e. even if
the boolean test condition is still true).
