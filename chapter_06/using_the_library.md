# Using the Java Library

## In the Java API, classes are grouped into packages.
To use a class in the API, you need to know which *package* the class is in. Every class in the Java library belongs to a package.

`javax.swing` is a package that holds some of the Swing GUI classes.
`java.util` holds utility classes

Use an `import` statement at the top of your source doe or type the full name every place you use the class in your code.
